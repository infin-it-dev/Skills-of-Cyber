# Daily Cybersecurity Challenges

Welcome to the Daily Cybersecurity Challenge Series! 🛡️
Each day, a new short challenge will test your skills in cryptography, forensics, OSINT, networking, and more.

---

## 📚 How It Works

- A new challenge is posted each day.
- Hints may be available after 24 hours.
- Solutions are posted separately for learning purposes.
- A file named ``flag_checker_gui.py`` is included with every challange and contains the correct flag, no peaking!

---

## 🎯 Flag Format

All challenge answers must be submitted in the following format:

```SoC{your_answer_here}
 SoC{placeflaghere}
```

* All lowercase letters unless otherwise specified
* No spaces unless the challenge says otherwise
* No punctuation unless otherwise specified
* Include the `SoC{}` exactly as shown
* EX: If the answer is "alert", submit it as `SoC{alert}`.
