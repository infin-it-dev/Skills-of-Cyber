# 🔐 Day 01: Cryptography - Caesar Was not just a King, It is also a cipher!

## Challenge Title:

**Caesar was not just a King!**

---

## 📜 Challenge Description:

You've just landed a new job and your boss gave you a basic cipher to decode!

Here is the cipher you are given:

SeeelyoltssbCcokoe{otifrwmhlc}

---

Your mission is to find the original, decrypted message.

## 📣 Flag Format

The flag you are looking for will be in the following format:

```text
SoC{your_answer_here}
```

* All lowercase unless otherwise specified
* No spaces unless specified

Example:

> If the original word is "example", the flag would be:
>
> `SoC{example}`

---

## ✏️ Instructions:

* This message was encrypted using a **rotational cipher** — but **not the basic Caesar you may know!**
* You may use:
  * Online cipher lookup databases
  * Brute-force decryption
  * Educated guessing
  * Pattern Recognition
* Check your answer with the Solutions repository found [**here**](https://github.com/infin-it-dev/Skills-of-Cyber-Solutions).
